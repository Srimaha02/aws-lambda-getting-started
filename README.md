# ⚡ AWS Lambda - Getting Started Project

This project demonstrates the basics of **Serverless Computing** using AWS Lambda.  
I created and executed a Python-based Lambda function and observed the execution logs in CloudWatch.

This is a foundational project for building **event-driven** and **API-driven** serverless applications.

## 🎯 Objectives

✔ Create a Lambda function from scratch  
✔ Write and deploy Python code  
✔ Configure test events to trigger Lambda  
✔ Execute function successfully  
✔ View execution logs in CloudWatch  
✔ Understand basics of serverless execution

## 🛠️ Steps Performed

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Created Lambda function (Python 3.13) |
| 2 | Replaced default code with "Hello from Lambda!" response |
| 3 | Configured and executed a Test Event |
| 4 | Viewed logs in CloudWatch |

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How AWS Lambda runs code **without servers**
- CloudWatch logs help in debugging
- Lambda works on **event-driven architecture**
- No cost until execution → very budget-friendly!

## 🚀 Skills Gained

| Skill | Focus |
|------|------|
| Serverless Architecture | Event-based execution |
| Python for Cloud Functions | Backend automation |
| AWS Monitoring | CloudWatch logs tracking |
| Developer Workflow | Code → Deploy → Test |

---

## 🌟 Next Steps

- Connect Lambda with **API Gateway** → Create an API  
- Trigger Lambda from **S3 events**  
- Schedule Lambda using **EventBridge**
